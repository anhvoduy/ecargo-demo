The solution includes two folders:
- server  : API and Web Application
- database: ecargo_demo
please try to open file: "/ecargo/database/ecargo_full_database.sql" to restore database
please try to open file: "/ecargo/server/services/config.js" to setup: username & password & database name

For start review:
- open command line in folder: "/ecargo/server"
- type:	npm install
- type: node server

- then, api and web application will run on port 3000 by default
- to access web application: "http://localhost:3000/"
